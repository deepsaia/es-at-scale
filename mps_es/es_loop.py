"""Device-agnostic Evolution Strategies mechanics (Algorithm 2 of the paper).

Deliberately free of model, HuggingFace and device assumptions: everything here
is in-place tensor arithmetic over a plain list of parameter tensors, so it can
be tested without loading an LLM and runs unchanged on mps, cuda or cpu.

The defining property is that perturbation noise is never stored -- only the
seed that generates it. Perturb, restore and update all re-derive the identical
noise from that seed, which is what keeps memory flat regardless of population
size.

This file repeats the perturb, restore and update maths from
`es_at_scale/utils/worker_extension.py`. The upstream versions are methods on a
class that vLLM mixes into its GPU worker, and they read the parameters from the
vLLM model runner, so they cannot be imported here. Moving that maths into one
shared module that both the vLLM worker and this file call would remove the
duplication. That is left for a separate change so this one touches nothing
outside `mps_es/`.
